## Overview:
In this project. I worked on a project where I looked at a lot of information to help online retail grow. The goal was to find important ideas that could help make smart decisions. I organized the work by cleaning up the raw data, doing a deep analysis, creating impactful visualizations, finding useful results, and then coming up with good plans for expanding online retail.

  - **Objective:** The aim is to give important information to the people involved, helping them make smart decisions for growing online stores. This will guide them in making well-informed choices for expanding in the online retail industry.
  - **Key Insights**:
    - Using data to guide decisions reveals unique patterns in different seasons, which can affect how we sell things.
    - Concentrating our efforts on certain countries and types of customers could lead to significant boosts in both earnings and the portion of the market we capture.

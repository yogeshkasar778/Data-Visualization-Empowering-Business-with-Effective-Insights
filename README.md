## Overview:
In this project. I worked on a project where I looked at a lot of information to help online retail grow. The goal was to find important ideas that could help make smart decisions. I organized the work by cleaning up the raw data, doing a deep analysis, creating impactful visualizations, finding useful results, and then coming up with good plans for expanding online retail.

  - **Objective:** The aim is to give important information to the people involved, helping them make smart decisions for growing online stores. This will guide them in making well-informed choices for expanding in the online retail industry.
  - **Key Insights**:
    - Using data to guide decisions reveals unique patterns in different seasons, which can affect how we sell things.
    - Concentrating our efforts on certain countries and types of customers could lead to significant boosts in both earnings and the portion of the market we capture.

## Data Source:
  Here's the [Online Retail sales raw data](https://github.com/yogeshkasar778/Tata-Group-Data-Visualization-Internship-Empowering_Business_with_effective_insights/blob/main/Task%201%20Framing%20the%20Business%20Scenario/Online%20Retail.xlsx)

## Business Problem:
 - Examine the monthly revenue data from 2011 to identify patterns related to seasons, improving our ability to predict sales accurately.
 - Create visual representations of the top 10 countries generating revenue (excluding the UK), including insights into the quantity of items sold. This information will be valuable for making strategic decisions.
 - Emphasize the top 10 customers based on revenue, focusing on strategies to retain these customers.
 - Identify regions with a strong demand for products across all countries (excluding the UK) to make well-informed decisions for expanding our business.

## Methodology:

**1.Data Cleaning**:
- I cleaned up the raw data to make sure it's accurate and complete. This involved a few important steps:
  - I filtered the quantity column to remove records where the quantity was below 1 unit.
  - Similarly, in the unit price column, I filtered out records where the price was below $0.
  - I also took care of any missing values in the customer ID column to ensure completeness and reliability of the data.
   
 **2.Analysis:**
   - Conducted a comprehensive analysis addressing four critical business questions.
      - Identified seasonal revenue trends, showcasing exceptional growth from **September to November**.
      - Identified top-performing countries in terms of revenue – **Netherlands, Ireland, Germany, and France**. Proposed specific strategies to improve their market positions.
      - Explored the top 10 customers, noting low variation and suggesting a strategy to enhance customer satisfaction.
      - Discovered regions with high product demand, recommending focused expansions that could potentially lead to a **25%** increase in overall revenue.

**Visualization using Power BI:**
 - Created a suite of visualizations for effective communication.
